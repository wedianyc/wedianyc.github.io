## Step 1: Moodboard

Did someone say moodboard?! It’s time to call the colleague that’s still
obsessed with Pinterest.

Share anything that has inspired you to create these assets. What visuals have
you seen that accurately capture what you’re hoping to accomplish? This content
provides WeDIA a clear understanding of the look and feel you want your final
deliverable(s) to embody. 

> In an era where “if it’s not on social media, it didn’t happen”, WeDIA creates
content with a social-first mindset.

If you’re interested in learning more about determining how to develop an
aesthetic, check out our blog post [Establishing Your Aesthetic](/blog/your-aesthetic).

## Step 2: Shoot

Whether it’s an event, product or headshot, WeDIA is prepared to have multiple
photographers/videographers on location and prepped with your moodboard in mind.


## Step 3: Edit & Optimize

Similar to our design process, our content editing is built in a format to allow
for iterations. An example schedule may be:

**Round 1**
* Initial edit of all photos/videos
* Client review/feedback - finalizing which photos/videos they will move forward
with

**Round 2**
* Make edits and revisions to selected photo/video
* Client review/feedback

**Round 3**
* Make edits and revisions to final client approved assets
* Final tweaks
* Deliver assets
