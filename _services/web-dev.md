## Phase 1: Understanding the Site 

First things first, tell us *everything*. For WeDIA to build you the most
impactful site possible, we want to fully understand your vision and the
functionality the site will be capable of delivering. Do site visitors need to
be able to book appointments? Make payments? Live chat? Etc. Go as far as to
share examples of websites you like and *don't* like. This provides a great
sense of what excites you, and what we should avoid.

We'll help you determine if it's a web*site* or a web *application* that you
will need. Web sites are typically static content, oftentimes managed through
what is known as a CMS (content management system, like Squarespace and
WordPress). Web applications, on the other hand, are dynamic content and offer a
level of interactivity. They have a certain "business domain" which provides the
user with the ability to perform a series of actions which provide value beyond
just viewing static data. Popular web "applications" include things like
Facebook, Airbnb, and the G-Suite of products by Google.

## Phase 2: Hosting

Having clarity around the scope of the site, WeDIA can determine which platform
is best to host the site on. Generally, if it's a web*site* (static content),
we'll go with either WordPress or Squarespace for more straightforward designs.
We also can provide you with custom hosting options for more advanced sites. For
web applications, we prefer to use Heroku.

WordPress is more expensive and time consuming, though it has the advantage of
beig fully customizable - meaning if you can dream it, we can build it.

Alternatively, Squarespace is a great fit for lower budget, fast turnaround
sites that need limited customization or advanced functionality. Since
Squarespace requires starting from a template (there are thousands to choose
from), WeDIA may not be able to customize every part of your site.

For more information about which hosting platform is best for you, check out our
blog post [Squarespace vs WordPress](/blog/squarespace-vs-wordpress).

As for web applications on Heroku, we find that it's best-practice due to the
massive availability of plugins, toolchains, and general ease of use. It's an
affordable and user friendly solution that integrates great with many web
application frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails and Python/Django. We love it, and
we think you will to.

## Phase 3: Sitemap

Consider a sitemap to be your websites “skeleton”. An example sitemap may look
like the following outline: 

**Home**
* Key value proposition
* Small "about" blurb - what is your product/service all about?
* Layout of services with link to services page
* Call to action - get the user to engage!
* Footer with location & business hours
* Contact information

**About Us**
* Include info about the company/employees

**Services**
* Depending on content and number of services, these could be on one page or
broken out into separate pages

**New Customers**
* New customer info
* Customer forms

**CTA**
* Basic form functionality that emails to designated person at your office

**Contact Us**
* Chat bots, email and engagement forms

## Phase 4: Development 

Agreed upon sitemap in hand, let the fun begin. While we’ll do the heavy
lifting, this is going to be a team effort - welcome to the squad! You will be
responsible for coming up with language to fill the site (i.e about section,
employee bio’s, etc). If this stresses you out, we came prepared to help. We
have templates/example content that you can work off of for each section you’ll
be responsible for. 

Throughout the entire process we line up weekly reviews between a WeDIA
developer and your team to touch base on your sites progress and make real time
adjustments. You may play as active of a role in the process as you’d like,
though we are conscious of your busy schedule. Combine the content you’ve built
out with our work on the formation of your site, and before you know it, the
site is live.
