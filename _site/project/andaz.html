		<p>Bringing community to a hotel.</p>

	</div>

</section>

<section class="single">

	<p><img src="/images/andaz/newyorkcity.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This sleek high-rise hotel in the financial district is 2 blocks from the New
York Stock Exchange, 7 blocks from South Street Seaport and 8 blocks from the
World Trade Center. With modern loft-style rooms that feature 11-foot ceilings,
oak floors and bleached wood window seats, Andaz Wall Street is a beautiful
property for anyone looking to enjoy the benefits of Manhattan while
simultaneously avoiding the crowds midtown.</p>

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>Andaz needed to highlight the community they were located in, but struggled to
diversify their content beyond traditional posts of rooms and event spaces.
Aside from the property itself, how could we shed light on the abundance of
activities, events, restaurants, and attractions that were right in the
neighborhood? Doing so would solidify that Andaz was the perfect hotel for your
next trip to NYC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They wanted to be a relevant part of that community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another aspect to be mindful of was that Andaz didn’t want to just show off the
community they happened to be in the middle of, they wanted to be a relevant
part of that community. The task was to not simply take advantage of a flashy
location, but to contribute and give back - an aspirational goal that WeDIA
is/was humbled to contribute to.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Andaz and WeDIA started small. The teams began with a brainstorming session to
discuss some of the key elements that have made the Financial District
attractive to more than just investment bankers and the usual Wall Street crowd.
Outside of running traditional ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter and LinkedIn, WeDIA suggested the idea of an “Insta-meet” hosted by
Andaz.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…how better to become a part of a community than to work with the people
that embody that community?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The theory behind this was multifold. For starters, we knew the property needed
an abundance of high quality content outside of the hotel, while remaining
conscious of budgets. Additionally, how better to become a part of a community
than to work with the people that embody that community? Not only would we bring
the community together, but the event would supply the hotel with hundreds of
photos to use on their marketing efforts.</p>

<p>In collaboration with a couple leading Instagram pages, Andaz and WeDIA put on a
200+ person insta-meet. Both professional and amateur photographers attended,
resulting in an amazing opportunity for the photography community to come
together and get to know each other. The underlying idea was that we utilize the
hotel as the starting and ending point of the event, while in between, the group
would explore and photograph some of the top attractions located in Lower
Manhattan. As they came back from their exploration, the properties beer garden
had free drinks ready to for an evening celebration.</p>

<p>Creators had the opportunity to win a free weekend stay by tagging the hotel in
their photos on social media - resulting in the gaining of hundreds of followers
and providing the WeDIA with a portfolio of professional visuals to share on
Andaz’s social channels.</p>

<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>

<p>Aside from supplying WeDIA with content, Andaz successfully took its first step
in being an active member of the community. Social media is meant to be social,
and Andaz completely embraced the opportunity to do something different. Andaz
has seen an increased interest through social media in the form of positive
reviews and click throughs to their booking site. We are thrilled to see how our
experience in the social media world played an active part in bringing a
community together.</p>

<p>Since then, Andaz has hosted similar events to increase awareness around the
opening of their remodeled restaurant and updated rooms/event spaces.</p>
