A curated aesthetic is one of the best ways to show off your brand’s unique
style and tone. If you want to attract new eyes, having a clean, consistent,
cohesive (that’s a lot of C’s!) aesthetic is the key to turning customers into
loyal fans.

## Why is a Cohesive Aesthetic So Important?

More and more people are turning to social media to search for their favorite
businesses - meaning your social profiles are just as important as your
website’s homepage.

When a visitor lands on your profile and knows exactly what they can expect to
see on your feed, they’re much more likely to hit that “follow” button.

## Creating an Aesthetic 

### Step #1: Choosing an Aesthetic
The first thing you’ll want to do is decide
on the aesthetic you want for your profile. A great way to get started is just
by looking for inspiration.

What do some of your favorite feeds look like? Are they bright and airy? Dark
and moody? Do they follow some sort of pattern? Taking the time to think about
these things while you’re browsing your favorite profiles will help you decide
what “aesthetic” will best represent you and your brand.

You’ll also want to consider what types of photos you’ll be posting. For
example, even if you prefer a light and bright feed, if you live somewhere like
Seattle, it may be a hard look for you to achieve.

Make sure you consider what and where you’ll be shooting, as this will be what
you can maintain consistently. And consistency is really key when you’re
creating your aesthetic and should be considered above all else.
 

### Step #2: Editing
The best way to create a cohesive aesthetic is during the
editing process. Choosing the same filter, set of filters or editing “rules”,
will help you keep your photos looking consistent and “fit” together.

If you’re looking to give your photos a more professional look, Lightroom is by
far one of the most powerful photo editing tools out there - especially because
you can use ready-made Lightroom presets.

### Step #3: Create Balance on Your Feeds
After you’ve edited your photos, you’re going to want to think about how they’ll
look next to each other. It’s
important to create “balance” on your feed, and make sure it’s not too busy or
cluttered. You want to make sure it’s easy for new eyes to move throughout your
feed without interruption.

The goal here is to create a depth
of field, similar to what you learn if you’ve ever taken a photography class. A
great way to do this is by placing more busy photos next to clean or minimal
photos to break things up a bit.

It takes some planning, but once you’ve created an aesthetic that really wows,
your company will surely stand out from the rest.
