2018 was a year for the books. From Zuckerberg finding himself testifying on
Capitol Hill to the co-founders of Instagram stepping down, 2018 was a year of
change for more than just the executive teams of these social platforms.
Algorithms, business profiles, the value of paid media, and every user's day to
day experience has seen some serious changes. Find below some things we should
all keep in mind going into 2019.

Before diving into the major changes, it’s important to first consider some of
the things that are the *same*.  Quality content is the name of the game.
Whether you have a paid budget behind a post or not, users demand quality. 
Video is continuing to lead the way that users consume content and take action.
Without a
paid approach, you only reach a fraction of you existing audience, and the odds
of you getting outside that sphere is minimal. Businesses need to be extra
creative, as the platforms favor personal accounts over business accounts.
Consistent posting is the key to staying relevant - develop a posting schedule
and stick to it.

Now, let’s get into a few key changes for each platform.

## Facebook

**Re-prioritising the feed**

Facebook “commits to prioritising friends and family” in an effort
to bring back more authentic content to the platform - penalizing “organic”
posts from business pages.

**Page info**

Any page running ads on Facebook is now forced to show which of their ads are
currently live. This can be found under the “Ads and Info” tab.

## Instagram

**Verification**

Instagram now lets you apply for a verification badge within the
app. It’s still really difficult to get verified, but the door seems to be
creeping open. 

**Instagram stories surpassed snapchat**

...basically killing snapchat.

**IGTV**

Instagram’s attempt to allow long form content to be hosted on their platform.
This is currently limited to vertical content, but we suspect it won’t
be long before they adapt.

**Algorithm**

They won’t be going back to chronological (despite all the
wishful rumors). Posts are prioritized by:
1. Interest
2. Recency
3. Relationship

**Instagram shopping**

The ability to tag/link to specific products in a post, allowing quick and easy
access for users to click through and shop directly from a post.

**Hashtag following**

Users can now “follow” a hashtag. 

**Ad transparency**

Similarly to Facebook, Instagram announced they will soon show which ads a
profile is associated with.
 
## Twitter

**Timeline**

Twitter announced that they will be allowing users to switch to a
chronological timeline. Users will have access to both a ‘best tweets first’
algorithm based timeline, or tweets in a reverse chronological order. While this
isn’t an active feature (yet), it’s important to be proactive with.

**Live video**

Twitter has joined the likes of Facebook by prioritising live video on people's
feeds. Twitter is now displaying live streams at the top of your timelines.

## LinkedIn

**Ranking**

LinkedIn provided further insight into how they rank organic posts:
1. Be of particular value to someone’s career, such as tips for their
professional growth.
2. Have industry relevance.
3. Be from a credible or trustworthy source (this refers to you as well as any
website you link to).

**Playing favorites**

LinkedIn announced they favor certain types of content - particularly formats
they’ve made a technological investment to develop.
