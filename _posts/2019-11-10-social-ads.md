With all leading social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube) capable of housing ads, understanding each platforms approach is a fundamental step in determining which will be most suitable to your audience, and to ensure you get the best ROI possible. 

## When to use Facebook /  Instagram

Given Facebook owns Instagram, we bundle the platforms together when looking at the advertising side. Ads for both platforms will be run through your companies Facebook Business Manager / Facebook Ad Account. 

Facebook and Instagram are best used when you have the following data for your determined audience: 

- Interests (i.e outdoor sports, interior design, cooking classes, etc.)
- Pages (i.e the pages they "Like" on Facebook)
- Location (while all platforms being discussed have geofencing capabilities, Facebook / Instagram allows for the most narrowed targeting. You may run ads to a radius as small as 0.5 miles)
- Age
- Behaviors (i.e investing, healthy eating, etc.)
- Email
- Phone
- Zip code

## When to use Twitter

- Keyword (i.e a specific hashtag or keyword/phrase)
- Interests
- Location (city, county, state or country level)
- @handle lookalike
- Email
- Phone
- Relationship status

## When to use LinkedIn

- Job title
- Industry
- Seniority
- Income
- Location (city, county, state or country level)

- Company

## When to use YouTube

YouTube ads are managed through Google, so depending on your objectives, these are frequently bid on based on keyword/phrase.

## Universal

By installing code (i.e Facebook Pixel) to your website, each platform is capable of retargeting your website traffic. This is a worthy and actionable step whether you are new or fully accustomed to social media advertising.
