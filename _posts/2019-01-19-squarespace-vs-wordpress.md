It’s 2019 and you want to create a top of the line website. Odds are, you’ve
heard of SquareSpace and Wordpress by now and if you’re someone new to the web
development world, you might be asking yourself what’s the difference? And even
if you understand the basic differences, how do you know which one is right for
you? Stick with us and let’s answer these questions.

## High Level Understanding

Squarespace is a website builder with the highest quality designer templates on
the market. It’s hosted for you, so you don’t have to worry about managing
updates or finding the perfect hosting provider. You don’t have to use custom
code, but the option is there if you’d like to add some advanced functionality.

WordPress also allows you to build your own website, but it’s not a website
builder - meaning you need to know how to code. Unlike SquareSpace, you have the
option to customize everything and have more advanced features. Because WP is
open source, if you can dream it, we can build it. 

## Break it Down

Squarespace is aimed at people who need a fast turnaround site on a limited
budget. You don’t need to code to create a website on Squarespace, but with its
high quality designs, people will have a hard time believing it.

WordPress requires custom code, and therefore needs more time/budget to develop.
You will need to code, and you will need to be happy managing, updating, and
protecting your own website (or working with us to help you do it). 

Overall, Squarespace offers an all-round package which is more suitable for more
people. It’s easier to use, but still builds professional and complex websites.
It’s less vulnerable to threats, and is much lower maintenance than WordPress.

WordPress has undeniably earned its reputation as the power platform of the
internet.
