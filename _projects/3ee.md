For any foodie with an expensive taste, 3ee is the service you need. 3ee’s goal
was to develop a dining experience that allowed their members to make
reservations at the most elite restaurants in NYC. Members would be limited to
a certain amount of reservations per month based on their subscription level.

> “3ee wanted to bring the hospitality of a world-class golf club and bring it
to the restaurant business.”

Upon arriving to a restaurant, members would be greeted by name, seated
immediately and walk out without paying on the spot. 3ee wanted to bring the
hospitality of a world-class golf club and bring it to the restaurant business,
taking care of payment and invoicing the customer later. This allowed the member
to avoid the extended end to a meal waiting for the check, while also ensuring
your guests don’t try to cover the bill on your behalf.

## Challenge

Although 3ee had a relatively simple idea, advanced functionality was needed to
make the service work as smoothly as possible. The most intricate part of
the process came when it was time to determine the information architecture and
user flow - ensuring that users could quickly sign up for 3ee, manage
their subscription, make a reservation at a desired restaurant, and complete a
payment. Similarly, restaurants needed access to 3ee in order to get client
information and invoice.


## Solution

WeDIA looped in both designers and developers to come up with feasible options
that were visually pleasing, while not resulting in a coding nightmare. By
having a user-first mindset, WeDIA trimmed down as much information as possible
in an effort to have the user take a minimal amount of steps for each part of
the process. 

## Outcome

3ee has begun private testing amongst a select set of users. So far, the
feedback has been nothing but positive as both restaurants and members are
experiencing a faster and more enjoyable experience.
