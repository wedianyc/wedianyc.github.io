## Overview

DOPE took an unconventional approach to drug awareness in the form of a clothing
collection and a corresponding lookbook. Through social commentary on trends and
the portrayal of drugs within commercial media, this collection aimed to be
provocative and unsettling. DOPE’s overall purpose is to educate people of the
destruction and true horror that comes within the world of heroin and opioids.

## Challenge

The main challenge with DOPE was to figure out how to bring the issue of drug
abuse to light, in a way that is culturally consumable. Many drug awareness
campaigns do not resonate with the audience and appear in stereotypical mediums
such as posters and video commercials. We asked ourselves, 'how might we make a
more memorable drug awareness campaign? What medium(s) have we not yet seen
this take place in?'

## Design

Many considerations were made and traditional approaches were taken at first to
build the concept. Many of these initial concepts were ruled out relatively
quickly, and we were able to hone in on fashion as the vehicle to communicate
our message.

> “Fashion often glamorizes drug abuse, with looks like heroin chic.”

Clothing is one of the most consumer-driven products as it is very trendy.
It's something we all have to consume every day. Fashion often glamorizes drug
abuse, with looks like 'heroin chic'. People pay attention to what's cool,what's
in. Clothing felt like the right vehicle to take a stand and present the issue
because clothing is such a part of the collective consciousness of consumerism.
Brands like SUPREME and Adidas hold a certain social status and unite people.
People pay attention to clothes, people pay attention to fashion. They're not
so much going to remember  a poster, but clothing and fashion occupies a
different mind space and is more memorable.

We decided we would be using the vehicles of beauty and consumerism to speak to
the culture of today.
