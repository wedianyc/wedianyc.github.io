## Overview

DOPE took an unconventional approach to drug awareness in the form of a clothing
collection and a corresponding lookbook. Through social commentary on trends and
the portrayal of drugs within commercial media, this collection aimed to be
provocative and unsettling. DOPE’s overall purpose is to educate people of the
destruction and true horror that comes within the world of heroin and opioids.

## Challenge

How to bring the issue of drug abuse to light, in a way that is culturally
consumable.

## Design

What medium? 

What considerations were made, what was ruled out, what drew you to chose a
clothing and lookbook to convey this concept?

> “Fashion often glamorizes drug abuse, with looks like heroin chic.”

Clothing is one of the most consumer-driven products. Very trendy. Something we
all have to consume every day. Fashion often glamorizes drug abuse, with looks
like 'heroin chic'.People pay attention to what's cool, what's in. Clothing felt
like the right vehicle to take a stand and present the issue because clothing is
such a part of the collective consciousness of consumerism. Fashion ofte
 glamorizes drug abuse, with looks like 'heroin chic'. Brands like SUPREME and
 Adidas hold a certain social status and unite people. People pay attention to
 clothes, people pay attention to fashion. They're not so much going to remember
 a poster, but clothing and fashion occupies a different mind space and is more
 memorable.


While using the vehicles of beauty and consumerism to speak to the culture of today.
