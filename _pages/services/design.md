## Phase 1: Understand the “Why?”

An essential part to developing any sort of branding or design asset (i.e logo,
presentation, packaging, etc) is to first understand your companies “why?”
WeDIA is adamant about learning why you do what you do so we can carry core your
values and passion to the visuals that represent your company. 

To learn more about what to focus on when developing an asset, check out our
blog post [Creating Your Brand Identity](/blog/brand-identity).

## Phase 2: Mockups & Examples

Draw it on a napkin - literally! No matter how bad you may be at drawing, give
it a shot. This simple visualization will give WeDIA valuable insight into what
is currently inspiring your reason for hiring us, and the direction we should
first explore. 

Share any previous marketing materials and brand guidelines. This is a perfect
time to divulge what you like or don’t like about past efforts, furthering our
understanding of how you want the company to be represented.

## Phase 3: Iterations

We now have what we need to begin our iterative design process. An example
schedule may be:

```
Round 1
Develop 3-5 initial design concepts
Client review/feedback
Round 2
Make edits and revisions to 1-2 Client approved designs
Client review/feedback
Round 3
Make edits and revisions to 1 Client approved design
Finalize design
Deliver final design and all deliverables
```
